       <div id="circle"></div> 
        <p>Leon is a digital media artist currently located the bay area. His interest began in high school, during art class. Then died out, but was rekindled again during his time at community college due exposure to many great artist and the spirit of history that is embodied in their works. <br><br>His works are based on the concept of the articulating the unconsciousness, using technology to confront the individual from within and give them a new outlook on life. This process brings back ancient ideas from history, installation, and video media.</p>
