          Title: Chaos and Order

            <h4> The logic that makes up for my use of my content is the deep archetypal myths and their motifs on how they relate to being. This content shows the myth of the hero venturing to defeat the tyrant. Bringing chaos into order. The reuse of the content enhances the historical context of myths in the source material. The ruined picture of Rome symbolizes the fall of order into chaos. The pyramid from the dollar bill shows order, but it's about to be destroyed and brought down into chaos by the tyrant: depicted as a dragon. The hero is shown as the knight prepares to restore order by slaying the dragon. Another mythological motif, the eye which on top of the pyramid symbolizes how important and the capacity to pay attention and to not ignore individual responsibility. Taking voluntary act to face chaos forthrightly, confront courageously, growing stronger, and reinstate internal or external order, becoming a hero the process. I think my work will live online, on image boards, or printed maybe.</h4>

              Medium: Photoshop <br>

            </h2>
            <h4>this project was built on the speculation of mythological motifs, The eye of horus: the egyptian god horus, is defined with a head of a falcon and human body.  the eye can be represented as paying attention. Paying attention is important on all levels, individually and culturally.

            Title: Collective Hero
            <br>
            Medium: Photoshop and paper collage
            <br>
          Modified: 1563x2048px
        </h2>
          <h4>The original work was jpeg done with photoshop. I translated the work into paper and made a collage, which was scanned into a jpeg. The concept of the work is based on mythological archetypes of the hero. I came up with this idea from watching lectures and reading passages of Carl Gustav Jung. Jung stated that universal, mythic characters archetypes reside within the collective unconscious–the part of the unconscious mind that is derived from ancestral memory and experience and is common to all humankind– representing fundamental human motifs of our experience as we evolved; therefore, they stimulate deep emotions.


          I chose the archetype of the hero with this in mind. The work has various containers of fragmented pieces of heroes throughout history to today: Superman, Thor, Hercules, Marduk, Thot, and Saint George. Each piece representing traits of the archetypal hero. When translating the work, I wanted to modify the aspects of color and placement of the pieces in the original work. The pieces heroes in black and white to symbolize old historic age, while the other pieces in color to symbolize a current relevance to today. After I printed it out, a collage was made on paper. This act of translation enhanced the meaning on a play of history on the traits archetypal myths of heroes. The foundations of the old mythological heroes in black and white; giving structure to the colored heroes today, having each color pieces in relief to let the black and white pieces to standout. To what happens when we convert jpegs, pngs, mp3 into another format, I think the file gains more context when it is converted.</h4>

          <h4>My process of making this was using the understanding of Zen to show a portrayal of snow. The quote is from a great Zen master, the quote gives a universal understanding of how the world is spinning and taking in the experience. The first half of the quote “Snow falls”  gives chaotic and random sense of snow falling onto the surface of earth. But then is met with “each flake in its appropriate place” this lends a sense of higher order given that snow falling is random. I used photoshop to make this piece. I made it because it calms the existential dread. </h4>

          <h4>Heart’s Content was a piece that’s been in my mind for a while. Generally it's about short term happiness comparing to long term happiness. The piece started off as a heart but then degenerated over the course of time. The piece is a tree which has its roots. I like to think of this as unhealthy happiness and healthy happiness. The source of unhealthy happiness stems from low class impulsive desires. Healthy happiness comes long-term and meaningful goals. I used adobe Illustrator to make this. I made this piece to raise awareness to this problem of unhealthy happiness </h4>

          <h4>I wanted to change sounds to encounter the viewer with an early morning feeling then lead them into an echoing tunnel. As the music progresses, the viewer becomes lost as the sounds get lost: in the process of editing eventually brought to an empty unfinished space. I took recordings of my backyard early morning, the sounds of birds, tapping on wood, and tapping on metal. I wanted to capture the environment of the early morning. The piece goes through transitions represented by recorded sounds of flipping pages. The sounds become edited heard by recordings of me scribbling and writing. The sounds from the environment take a new approach: echoing, phasers, fading in and out, and overlays.  Felt like I was painting an environment as I worked on this piece.</h4>

          <h4>This was a video project that I made with my classmates for art history class, Introduction/theory of new media. With the vast amount and various forms of information that surrounds the important issue of gun control, how does one find truth in media today? Do we find it by simply watching the news, or by reading it in memes on social media? How can we filter through all of the content available to us, to get to the core meaning of an important issue?</h4>
