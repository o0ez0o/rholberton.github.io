      <h1>Artist Statement</h1>

      <p>My practice as an digital media artist is to make the unconsciousness into the consciousness with the use of current and future technologies. My aim as an artist to make people see things in the world in a different perspective—shaping how people understand determines how they see— using of technology to liberate and improve the individual. Awaking the collective unconsciousness within the individual through the use of video, projections, installations, and experimental digital art. <br> <br>
      What's there? Personally I thinks art teaches people how to see. Art is interesting and unsafe. Artist are able to show an conceptual space between order and chaos— which are the fundamental building blocks of reality—  showing dynamism, both exciting and frightening, expanding the domain of order into the domain of chaos. My inspiration is from what I see in today’s culture, growing up within this postmodern culture I noticed people are lost in totalitarian ideologies or nihilism. Articulated as the Nietzsche dilemma: the death of god, Jung was a student of Nietzsche and recommends the way of the individual to revivify the dead gods. In other words Jung recommended to the people to the path of individuation. I want my viewers to be able to be enlightened, instead of rejecting their state of being they should improve upon it. </p>
