    <h1>Artist Statement</h1>

    <p>I am a multi-media artist mostly using technology including digital media, computer coding, and video installations to express my thoughts. I also incorporate hands on photography and painting. The inspiration for most of my works comes from historical events or currents political and cultural issues. I seek to express my own story as well as other people’s stories when dealing with these topics.<br><br>
 
    Today’s technology has brought a lot of opportunities and comfort in our life. As people get more tied
    up with hectic daily routines, they seek new ways to save time. With the help of internet they can easily
    stay in touch with each other, run errands faster, and get constant updates on the news. But this easy
    access to the internet has also had its own negative impact. Constantly being exposed to such a massive
    amount of information has the effect or making people numb to the struggles and hardships people
    experience in the world. This is especially true on social where people can see quick summaries of new
    stories popping up in their newsfeed by the minute.<br><br>
     
    Because of my background in social documentary photography and having more than eight years’
    experience as an art director in the field of media, I have been able to dig more deeply into topics
    related to political, social and cultural issues. The topic of revolutionary protest movements in the
    middle east are one such topic that I have had firsthand experience documenting in Iran and that I seek
    to explore in my art. In Iran, we have seen the unprecedented change of a religious government taking
    power, and the everyday challenges this has presented for the people of my generation who live under
    this regime. Topics relating to immigration, war, political change, and stresses that people encounter in
    life are my main concerns in creating art. I am concerned with issues, specifically those that affect the
    everyday life of people in the countries of conflict, like in much of the Middle East today. I want to
    create art that makes people in the West stop and think about the culture and the struggles that people
    in those parts of the world face. Because I am originally from Iran, I especially want to make people in
    the West more familiar with Iran in a deeper way. Since many people these days just ignore the news or
    are no longer sensitive to what they see in the media, storytelling through art is the most engaging way
    to share the stories of the people.<br><br>
    ​
    In terms of technique, I assume having a title of digital media artist may lead most people think this
    form of art is only a way to express issues related science fiction, fantasy, and technology. What I am
    trying to do as a digital media artist is to use these new forms of art as a platform to share stories that
    deal directly with current events and political issues taking place in the world today. I also make art that
    encourages participant’s collaboration with my work. I would like to share my concerns with an
    audience that is not just seeing my work, but also participating in my art piece. I will give people this
    experience primarily through interactive art, video art and VR.
